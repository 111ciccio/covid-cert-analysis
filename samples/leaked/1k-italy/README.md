# 1k Italian COVID Passes Leak

On 2021-11-19 the following IPFS link was posted on RaidForums:

https://bafybeia6x6lu4tlhjtt7dswqicrruatfplcldu2zy5dommrb2w3fu3jnqq.ipfs.infura-ipfs.io/

The website contains a searchable list of COVID Certificates issued by the italian Ministry of Health, with a call to action to upload more certificates via a Mega.co.nz link.  
  
Most likely this is just a collection of scanned COVID Certificates at a venue / different venues with a modified scanner app (that logs / saves the certificates).  
  
Unfortunately the Digital Green Certificate specification doesn't allow the users to generate some short-lived certificates, and thus these leaked certificates will be valid until they:
1. Expire
1. Get revoked  
  
To avoid appearing in such a list, and if your country supports it (e.g: Switzerland), switch to a short-lived certificate instead (e.g: Certificate light).
